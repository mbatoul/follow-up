# Consortium follow-up

## May 11th 2021

### Gael
- Scikit-learn Inria internal meeting
    - Community and communication job profile
    - Bigger umbrella organisation inside Inria which will have resource dedicated to Inria's priorities (helping the French industry, Inria academy...)
- Recruiting engineer for MOOC
    - https://recrutement.inria.fr/classic/offre/show/3690

### Alex
- [Quantile regression](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9978) stand by waiting for [#20069](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20069)

### Chiara
- [Communication guidelines](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20048)
- [Push minimum scipy version to 1.0.0](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20069)
- MiniBatchNMF : applying transform at the end of the fit_transform does not improve the test about fit.transform ~ fit_transform
- preparing a community job profile

### Olivier
- MOOC milestone 1.0 (critical feedback from Beta tester, in particular on quiz)
- Reviewing:
    - 1.0 deprecation [#19335](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19335)
    - `_deprecated_positional_args` [#20002](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20002)
- Design discussion for part 2 of Mathis' internship (speed of randomized hyperparams search)
- Interactive debug session with Guillaume on GP periodic kernel [#19343](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19343)

### Mathis
- Implemement a first version of randomized hyperparams search approach (`scikit-learn` runs well but `lightgbm` runs forever)
- Several improvements on existing benchmark suite
- Pair programming with Julien on Cython and git workflow to get up to speed
- Started reviewing [Julien's PR on working memory](https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/pdist_agregation/pull/3/commits/e25c638b2875374c24bee1d6a5eb59ec5f0c901a)
- *Are there simple Cython issues that I can start looking at?*

### Jérémie
- plots for MiniBatchDL (obj function and dict change over steps).
- discussion with Mathis & Julien mainly about pairwise distances + reduction.

### Julien
 - Some more onboarding on Cython, git and setup tips for Mathis
 - Worked on the parallel KNN-implementation
     - [Repository](https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/pdist_agregation)
     - [Benchmark last results](https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/pdist_agregation/pull/3#issuecomment-838562878)
     - To be documented for reproducibility + fix typo, as pointed out by Olivier
     - Setup GitHub actions to run bench online
     - Working on a new strategy for parallelisation
 - PR reviews:
     - I need to take time to rereview: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19088
     - I need other points of view for the relevance of: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19562

### Guillaume
- Helped for the MOOC
- Learning stuff about Gaussian Process
- Unbiased tree MDI [#20059](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/20059)
  - related to [#19710](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19710)?

### TODO / Next
- Hire engineer for MOOC: Gael, Olivier, Guillaume, Loic
- Olivier + Julien (+Mathis +Jeremie?): discuss Julien's benchmark results
- Julien:
    - continue iterating between benchmarks and implementations
    - Cython+ experiments
- Jérémie: DL, NMF, `n_features_in_`
- Mathis:
    - Keep working on randomized HP search approach
    - Help Julien with pairwise_distances
    - More Cython
- Chiara :
  - convergence criterion for MiniBatch, 
  - Consortium roadmap text
